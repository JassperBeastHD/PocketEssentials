WARNING: 
PocketEssentials 3.0.0-Beta and earlier configs are NOT compatible anymore. 

How to Fix: 
1: Delete all folders in plugins folder from your PocketMine folder and install as normal. 
2: Re-Setup permissions. 
3: Permissions for commands are "&.COMMAND" now, such as "&.kill". 
4: You need to allow to use the command if it has permission nodes check inside it if you want to 
   use only that permission node. No need to add command if you want to dis-allow all features in 
   that command.
